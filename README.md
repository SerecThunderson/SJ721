• conservation of NFT IDs when broken -- when you "burn" NFT 5 you can get it later

• Ranged NFT IDs within ONE token to ensure no frontend marketplace trick

• No whitelist or pair addresses minus the developer address

• Split library events for better interaction between dapps -- note our etherscan actually works

Overall the logic is simplified, and more powerful
